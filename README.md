The Insider application checks the effect of insider trades on the top 10 AI companies closing price after 1 week of the filing date and compares the trend by using machine learning models.
It downloads 3 years of market daily closing from Yahoo Finance and the insider trade with SEC (Form 4) for the top 10 AI companies

## Analysis Report

* The purpose of the analysis is to examine how corporate insider trades change the trading environment.
* The individuals who engage in insider trading are typically corporate insiders, such as company executives and board members
* Corporate Insiders can only trade their Corporation's Securities during certain windows of time when there is no material non-public information that might affect a buyer or seller's trading decision.
* Insiders are generally contrarian investors and will sometimes purchase their own companyâ€™s stock following recent stock underperformance that they may feel is unjustified. 
* We found that Insider trades affect the closing price within 1 week after the filing date.
* comparing the 3 models the XGboost has outperformed the other evaluated models.
* Our findings reinforced the important role of insider trades in providing fundamental information and aiding price discovery
